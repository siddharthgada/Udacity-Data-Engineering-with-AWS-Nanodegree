# To run the dags in L3, L4, L5 follow these steps:
- Create IAM User (to give access to Airflow UI)
- IAM User needs to have the following existing policies:
  - AdministratorAccess
  - AmazonRedshiftFullAccess
  - AmazonS3FullAccess
- Create an Access Key so that the credentials can be used to configure the AWS connection in Airflow
- Create IAM Role (to give full access to S3)
- IAM Role needs to have the following existing policies:
  - AmazonS3FullAccess
- Create a Redshift Serverless workspace and namespace
  - Associate IAM role created while configuring the workspace and namespace
  - Turn on enhanced VPC routing
  - Edit the workspace to be publicly accessible
  - Add an inbound rule to the VPC Security Group in EC2
    - Type = Custom TCP
    - Port range = 0 - 5500
    - Source = Anywhere-iPv4
- Configure S3 and copy source data to your own bucket
- Set up Airflow connections:
  - AWS credentials (Airflow Connections to AWS Account using the IAM User Access Key)
  - Redshift connection (Airflow Connections to AWS Redshift using workspace endpoint)
- Edit the S3_bucket and S3_key in the DAG to the bucket and key you created and have loaded the files in
- Run the DAG from Airflow UI
- Monitor task execution and logs
